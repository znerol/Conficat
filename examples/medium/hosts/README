hosts: generate /etc/hosts for a local network
==============================================

This example demonstrates the use of row templates to generate hosts-files for
all devices in a local network. Both of the templates define the outfile
function returning a path dependant from the hostname column of the row to
separate the configfiles into directories named after the hosts found in the
CSV file.

There are two types of row templates: ipv4only and ipv6. The former lacks ipv6
local loopback entries.

Run it with the following command line (output written to stdout):
  conficat -r rtmpl hosts.csv -O .

You'll find the generated files in ./conf
